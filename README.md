Hi, I'm **Cameron**, a fourth year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University! 🦝

I'm currently involved in my schools *robotic soccer* club which you can find more information about [here](https://gitlab.com/sfurs/software). ⚽

Here are the projects I'm most proud of for each year I've been at SFU:
1. A maze solving robot, built with lego mindstorms and programmed in RobotC. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7ReQ-L2cR8)
2. An emergency reporting website made to replicate the look of Windows98. Using React, LeafletJS, and JSX/CSS. [Website here](https://camblsoup.github.io/CMPT272Proj/)
3. A small "mini golf" game that was made for a networking class. There are instructions to build and run there game in [this repository](https://github.com/camblsoup/MiniatureGolf). Expect bugs as it was built over a week for a class project...
4. Just started fourth year so this will be updated later!

Other than that in my free time I enjoy:
- Cooking 🍳
- Music 🎵
- Skiing ⛷️
- Hiking ⛰️
- Video Games 🎮
